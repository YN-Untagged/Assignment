        <h1>A FLOWER STORY</h1>
        <p>
            Once, in the early spring, two seeds were dropped not far from a river. One grew into a daisy, with soft white petals and a sunny yellow middle. The other grew into a rose, sweet and graceful, <br>
            with petals the color of a summer sunset. They grew together, and were the best of friends.<br>
            One summer day, the rose said to the daisy, "I would like to see the world. I want to travel to faraway places, and see what it's like where other flowers grow."<br>
            "Why would you want to do that?" the Daisy asked. "I like it right here by our river. It's beautiful and peaceful, just the right place for two flowers."  
            "I suppose you're right", the rose sighed. "Besides, I couldn't leave you." And the two friends promised
            that they would never leave their place on the river bank.<br>
            But the very next day, a child was walking down to the river, and spied the rose's pink petals. "Oh, what a lovely flower", she said. "I'll take it home and give it to mother." <br>
            And she walked over and plucked the rose right out of the ground.<br>
            The daisy watched as her friend was taken away, unable to do anything to help. And she wept. Very few have ever heard a flower cry, and those who have say that there is no sound in the world more sad.<br>
            The child brought the flower home, where it was loud and busy and not at all fit for a little rose. The mother put the rose in a vase, and after a few days, that pretty little rose wilted, as flowers who have been taken from the ground do.<br>
            The daisy knew it was impossible that her friend would ever come back, but that didn't stop her from hoping. And there she sat, waiting and weeping all through summer, and right on into the fall. And that little flower waited right up until winter, when,<br>
            exausted and cold, she curled up and wilted. The daisy and the rose were reunited at last.<br>
            And so, I beg you, if you see two flowers growing sweetly together, do not pick one and put it in a vase on your table, but leave it there. Because, even for flowers, life is better when you have someone by your side.<br>
